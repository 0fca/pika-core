            <h2>How does Pika Cloud work?</h2>
            Pika Cloud allows you to download files from my server without any form of registration.
            However, registered users have some fine features like overall access to server's storage, zipping a folder to quick download all its content or upload small files to the server(planned feature.)

        <div class="row-content">
            <h2>How can I register?</h2>
            There are two ways of registering you to the system: local registration or via Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Discord.
            Choose which you want, it doesn't matter because all grants given to registered user are all same!
