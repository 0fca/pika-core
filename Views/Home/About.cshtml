                Hi! I’m Obsidiam, I’m Polish Java&amp;C# developer.
                I'm desktop, mobile and web developer. My target is to be a good developer working in enterprise development.
                I am a freelancer too and a student of technical college at ITC. 
            </p>
            <p>I am a typical "nerd". I love coding especially in C# and Java/Kotlin. I am a hobbyst sysadmin(I have my own homelab server). Next to IT I like learning history, listen to music and learn about how to analyze it in digital manner. I like long walks, riding a bike and skiing. </p>

                It is FMS - File Management System and it means this is a little cloud system set up on my own server. 
                It is my first web app I've ever build. I used C# with ASP.NET Core 2.1 SDK to do it.
